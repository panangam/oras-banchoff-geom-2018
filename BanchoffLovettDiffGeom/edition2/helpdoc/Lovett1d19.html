<body>
This demo includes three graphical display windows. <br>
<br>
The window "Parametric curve and velocity vector" displays the graph of
X(t) (which you can alter in the appropriately labeled textbox), the
point X(t<sub>0</sub>), and the velocity vector
X'(t<sub>0</sub>) with base X(t<sub>0</sub>).<br>

<br>
The window "Graph of speed s'(t)" displays the graph of s'(t) =
||X'(t)|| in cyan, with the area shaded in blue below it representing
the integral of s'(t) from the minimum value of t to t<sub>0</sub> or
the maximum value of t (depending on whether or not the "Show entire
curve" option is selected).<br>
<br>
The window "Graph of arclength s(t)" displays the graph of s(t)
obtained by integrating s'(t) as displayed in the "Graph of speed
s'(t)" window.<br>
<br>
Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.
<br>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
"Show Color Spectrum" also colors the velocity vectors, and the two speed graphs.
