This demo displays the circle given by X(t) = (a,b) + (Rcos(t), Rsin(t)).
To change
(a,b), click and drag on the point labeled "(a,b)".  To change R, click and drag the point
labeled "R".  To move the
point X(t<sub>0</sub>) along the circle use the arrow buttons ([&lt;], [&gt;], [&lt;&lt;],
[&gt;&gt;]), which have the same function as in the first two demos. As
in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve", "Show position
vector X(t0)", and "Show Color Spectrum" options.<br>
