The window "Curve: X(t)"  in this demonstration displays the curve X(t)
= (cos(t), sin(t), cos(2t)/c), the point X(t<sub>0</sub>), and Tangent Vector of the curve
<p> The window "Tangential Indicatrix"  displays the path of the tangent vector on a transparent sphere.<p>

 As in earlier demos, there are "Show Color Spectrum", and "Show Entire Indicatrix" checkboxes.
 <p>
The partialcurvature readout displays the total space curvature of the curve from t0_min to t0.
The totalcurvature readout displays the total space curvature of the entire curve.
<p>

Fenchel's Theorem tells us that the total curvature must be at least 2&pi;.
