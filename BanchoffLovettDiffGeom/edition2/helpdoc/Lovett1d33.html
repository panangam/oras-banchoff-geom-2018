<p>This demo takes any of our standard curves in white and shows the first Taylor polynomial at a point X(t0) in red, the second Taylor polynomial at that point in orange, and the third Taylor polynomial in Yellow. As we take Taylor polynomials of higher and higher degree, we can approximate the curve as closely as desired over a larger and larger neighborhood of t0.
