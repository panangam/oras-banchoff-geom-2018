<P>This demonstration studies the graph of the Gaussian curvature of a surface that is a function graph. <br><br> In the "Domain" window one can control a square patch that is shown on the function graph surface and on the normal image of the function graph surface. <br><br> The Gaussian curvature graph window displays K(u,v) over the whole specified domain and is colored by red for positive curvature and blue for negative curvature.
