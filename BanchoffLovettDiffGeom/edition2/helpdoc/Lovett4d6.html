This demo displays a sphere and a curve on the sphere. <br><br>
The length of the curve is given in a readout in the control
window.<p>
Changin the value of t0 moves the point P on the curve, and point Q is a distance
from P along the curve determined by u0.  This distance from Q to P along the curve is given by the second readout.
The distance from P to Q along the curve is given by the third readout.
A midpoint between P and Q, M, is displayed on the sphere,
as well as a red equator for which M is the north pole.
<p>
The checkbox X(u) displays the curve from Q to P, and the variable alpha will rotate the curve from 
P to Q about the vector determined by M.
<p>
According to Horn's Lemma, if the length of the curve is less than 2&pi;, we can find a hemisphere
such that the curve lies entirely within that.
<p>
This demo illustrates the idea of the proof in the following way.  For any t0, we can find a u0
such that P and Q are exactly half way around the curve from each other.  Thus, with X(u) turned off,
we are looking at a curve of at most lenght &pi;.  If any portion of the curve intersects the red equator,
when changing the value of alpha to 0 to rotate the other half curve, the other half curve will intersect
the equator at an antipodal point.  The distance between any two antipodal points is at least &pi;, thus 
the lenght of the entire curve must be at least 2&pi;.  Therefore the curve of lenght less than 2&pi; will
not intersect the equator.
