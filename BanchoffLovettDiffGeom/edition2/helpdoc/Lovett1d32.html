In this demo, the function X(t) = (t, abs(tan(t))) is graphed from -&pi;/2 to  &pi;/2, along with the unit tangent vector, which is not defined at t = 0.  The limit as t approaches 0 from the left makes an angle of &pi;/2 with the limit of t as T approaches 0 from the right.  This is an example of a critical point known as a "corner."
