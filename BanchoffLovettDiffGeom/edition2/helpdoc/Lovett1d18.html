<body>
This demo includes two windows. The first displays the curve X(t) that
you can alter in the
appropriately labeled textbox, the point X(t<sub>0</sub>), and the
velocity vector
X'(t<sub>0</sub>) with base X(t<sub>0</sub>). The second window
displays the velocity vector
X'(t<sub>0</sub>) with its base at the origin and the curve X'(t<sub>0</sub>)
traced out by the head
of the vector. You also have the option of showing the
acceleration vector X''(t<sub>0</sub>) tangent to the curve in the
second window
at the point X'(t<sub>0</sub>) by clicking the appropriate checkbox in
the control
window.<br>
Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.
<br>
As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
"Show Color Spectrum" will also color the velocity vector and the velocity curve.
