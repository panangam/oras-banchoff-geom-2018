<P>This demonstration is similar to the various demos on Gaussian curvature in that there is a square patch in the Domain window that can be moved around and resized using the two hotspots. The patch is color-coded and its image apears on the surface. The third window displays a graph of the mean curvature of the surface at each point in the domain. The graph of <tt>H(u,v)</tt> is colored using a gradient so that graph is blue whenever <tt>H(u,v)&lt;0</tt>, white whenever <tt>H(u,v)=0</tt>, and red whenever <tt>H(u,v)&gt;0</tt>. This coloring scheme makes it easy to tell whether a surface is minimal.
