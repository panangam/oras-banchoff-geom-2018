This demo displays the several example functions of convex curves.
A convex curve is a closed curve, where any two points in the interior of the curve
may be connected by a straight line which does not leave the interior of the curve.
To change which funtion is viewed,
type the function title into the definition of X(t).  For example, X(t)=ellipse(t).
<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
