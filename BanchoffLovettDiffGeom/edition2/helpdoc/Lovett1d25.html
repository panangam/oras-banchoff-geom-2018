<body>
This demo includes a single graphical window that displays a curve
X(t) (which you may change in the appropriate textbox in the control
window), the parallel curve to X(t), and line segments of length r
normal to X(t) demonstrating the relationship between X(t) and its
parallel curves.<br>
Change the value of r as variables as in earlier demos.
