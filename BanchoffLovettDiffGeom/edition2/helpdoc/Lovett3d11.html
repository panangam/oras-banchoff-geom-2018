<body>
This demo includes three graphical display windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t), and its Frenet Frame.<br>

<br>
The window "Unit Tangent (T), Unit Normal (P), and Unit Binormal (B)"
displays the Frenet Frame at the origin,
and B'(t<sub>0</sub>), the derivative of B(t) evaluated at t<sub>0</sub>,
with its tail starting at the head of B(t<sub>0</sub>).<br>
<br>
The window "Torsion(t)" graphs the torsion of X(t).<br>

<br>
You can change t<sub>0</sub> and X(t) in the control window. The
control window
includes a list of functions that you can use for X(t), along with
parameters used to define those functions.<br>
<br>
As in previous demos there is a "Show Color Spectrum" checkbox.
