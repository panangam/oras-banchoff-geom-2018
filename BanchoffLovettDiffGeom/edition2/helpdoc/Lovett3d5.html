<body>
This demo includes a single graphical display window that displays the
curve X(t) = (a*cosh(t)*cos(t), a*cosh(t)*sin(t), b*sinh(t)). You can
change t<sub>0</sub>, a, and b in the control window.<p>

<p>
As in previous demos there are "Show Color Spectrum", "Show entire curve", and "Show position vector" checkboxes.
Additionally in this demo, you may display the hyperboloid on which the curve lies.
