<p>This applet shows together the projections of a sphere onto the plane via the three common cylindrical projections.  The color on the sphere corresponds to color gradations on the disk of the map.  This applet shows all cylindrical maps at the same time.

<p>The apple also shows a "rectangular" coordinate patch (with respect to theta and phi) along with the projection of that patch onto the cylindrical maps.  The location and width of the patch can be controled by the value of the parameters in the textboxes a, b, p, and q.
