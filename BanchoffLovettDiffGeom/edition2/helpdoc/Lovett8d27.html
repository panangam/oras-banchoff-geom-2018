<P>This applet gives a demonstration of the formula for the area of a spherical triangle.  We can choose the points P, Q, and R on the sphere  and display the triangle they determine.  By entering "false" in the Boolean expressions, we can shut off the two lunes of a given color which start at a vertex of the triangle, leaving only the triangle and its antipodal triangle.  The area of the double-lune with angle &alpha; is to 4&pi; as &alpha; is to 2&pi; so the double-lune area is 4&alpha;.  The three double-lunes intersect exactly in the triangle T and its congruent antipodal triangle, covering the rest of the sphere exactly once.  Thus the sum of the areas of the double lunes will be 4&pi; + 4A(T) = 4&alpha; + 4&beta; + 4&gamma; so A(T) = &alpha; + &beta; + &gamma; - &pi;.  This is the famous formula of Herriot and Giraud.
