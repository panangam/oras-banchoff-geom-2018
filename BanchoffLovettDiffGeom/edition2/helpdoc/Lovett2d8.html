<body>
This demo includes two graphical display windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t) and the point X(t<sub>0</sub>).<br>

<br>
The window "kg(t)" shows a graph of kg(t) and the point (t<sub>0</sub>,
k<sub>g</sub>(t<sub>0</sub>)).
Note that, as stated in the Four-Vertex Theorem, there are always at
least four critical points of k<sub>g</sub>(t).<br>
<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there is the "Show Color Spectrum" option.<br>
