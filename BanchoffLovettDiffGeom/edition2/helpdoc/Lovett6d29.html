<p>This applet shows together the projection of a sphere onto the plane via any of four azimuthal projections.  The color on the sphere corresponds to color gradations on the disk of the map.  In order to choose the desired azimuthal projections, the user can type the desired projection into the applet box indicated by r(theta).  For example, to see the stereographic projection, the user will type Stereographic(phi) into the r(phi) box.

<p>The apple also shows a "rectangular" coordinate patch (with respect to theta and phi) along with the projection of that patch onto the azimuthal map.  The location and width of the patch can be controled by the value of the parameters in the textboxes a, b, p, and q.
