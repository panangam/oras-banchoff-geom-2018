This demo displays two graphical windows: the domain of a surface and that surface.
The domain contains two hotspots to determine a point and a yellow vector.  The point is then displayed
on the surface with the tangent vector to the surface in the direction determined by the vector in the domain.<p>

The surface window displays the surface with a red curve on the surface in the direction of the tangent vector which is the
intersection of a plane determined by vectors N and T with the surface.
It also displays the transparent blue osculating sphere of the surface at that point, as well as the cyan osculating circle
of the red curve on the sphere.<p>

Another plane is displayed which is determined by the tangent vector T and a vector obtained by rotating
down the normal vector N by alpha, which may be changed in the control window.
The intersection of this plane with the surface is displayed as a green curve, and the magenta
osculating circle of this curve is displayed.<p>

According to Meusnier's Theorem, the magenta osculating circle will always lie on the osculating sphere.<p>

Checkboxes in the control window allow you change the visibility of the magenta osculating circle, the blue
osculating sphere with the cyan osculating circle, and the plane determined by N and T.
