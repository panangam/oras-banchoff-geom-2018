<p>In this applet a closed curve X(t) on a surface is defined by the boundary of a disc on the surface, and the tube of radius r is created as X(t) + r*cos(s)*U(t) + r*sin(s)*N(t) where N(t) is the surface normal and U(t) is the vector N(t) x T(X)(t).  The surface is a torus and the tube around the curve is colored by light green when the Gaussian curvature is positive and dark green when it is negative.<p>
