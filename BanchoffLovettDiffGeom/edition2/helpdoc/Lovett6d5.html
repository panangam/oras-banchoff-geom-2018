The window "Curve on Domain" displays a domain, a
point P in the domain, the curve P + t(cos(&#952;), sin(&#952;)) (where t
runs from 0 to t<sub>0</sub>), and the point P + (cos(&#952;),
sin(&#952;)), which is
the endpoint of the curve that is not P. <br><br> The window  "Curve on Surface" displays the surface X(u,v) and the image of the curve and two points
in the domain on that surface. <br><br> The window "Arclength"  displays the
graph of arclength as a function of t<sub>0</sub>. <br><br> It is possible to
click and
drag P in the "Curve in Domain" window and to change t<sub>0</sub>,
&#952;, and
X(u, v) in the control window.<br>
