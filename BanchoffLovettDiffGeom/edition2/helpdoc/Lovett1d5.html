This demo shows two vectors, A and C, and their difference, C &#8211; A. The
control window displays the lengths of A and C, the expression C &#8211; A,
and the length of C &#8211; A. To change A or C, click and drag the
appropriately labeled point.  To change the rounding behavior of the readouts,
