The window "Domain" displays a domain and a point (u<sub>0</sub>,
v<sub>0</sub>) in the domain.<br><br> The window "Surface: X(u, v)" shows the hyperbolic paraboloid X(u, v) = (u, v, u<sup>2</sup> &#8211;
v<sup>2</sup>)
and
the images of (u<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>) and the colored subset of
the domain on this
surface (with each point in the domain mapped to a point of the same
color). <br><br> The window "Normal Image"  shows the surface produced by mapping
each point on the surface X(u,v) to its unit normal vector, preserving
the coloring from the "Surface" window. <br><br> It is possible to change the
point (u<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>) and the colored subset of the
domain by clicking and
dragging the points shown in the "Domain" window.

In this demo, we indicate a surface and its tangent plane at p, and, in a separate window, the tangent plane at p viewed perpendicular to the unit normal vector at p. We may select a vector A in the tangent plane and the demonstration shows the image vector dn<sub>p</sub>(A).
