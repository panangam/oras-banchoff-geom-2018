The window "Domain" displays a domain, a point (u<sub>0</sub>,
v<sub>0</sub>) in the domain, a subset of the domain colored white,
red, blue, and magenta, and a point on the boundary of this subset.<br><br> The window "Torus" shows the surface X(u, v) (which by default is the torus X(u, v)
= ((2 + cos(v))cos(u), (2 + cos(v))sin(u), sin(v))), the images of (u<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>), and the colored subset of
the domain on this
surface (with each point in the domain mapped to a point of the same
color). <br><br> The window "Normal Image"  shows the surface produced by mapping
each point on the surface X(u,v) to its unit normal vector, preserving
the coloring from the "Torus" window. <br><br> It is possible to change the
point (u<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>) and the colored subset of the
domain by clicking and
dragging the points shown in the "Domain" window, and it is possible to
change X(u, v) in the control window.<br>
