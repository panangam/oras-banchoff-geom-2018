This demo includes a single graphical display window that displays the
cylindrical helix X(t) = (a*cos(t),a*sin(t),bt). You can change t<sub>0</sub>,
a, b, and X(t) and choose whether or not to show
the entire curve and the position vector X(t<sub>0</sub>) in the
control window. You can also choose whether or not to show the cylinder
of radius a with the z-axis as its axis of symmetry, which is the
cylinder on which X(t) lies.<br>
