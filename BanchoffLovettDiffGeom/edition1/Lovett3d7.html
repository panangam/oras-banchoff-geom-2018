This demo includes a single graphical display window that displays the
curve X(t) = (a*cosh(t)*cos(t), a*cosh(t)*sin(t), b*sinh(t)). You can
change t<sub>0</sub>, a, b, and X(t) and choose whether or not to show
the entire curve and the position vector X(t<sub>0</sub>) in the
control window. You can also choose whether or not to show the
hyperboloid of one sheet on which X(t) lies.<br>
