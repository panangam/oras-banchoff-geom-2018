This demo displays the epicycloid given by X(t) = ((a + b)cos(t) &#8211;
bcos(((a + b)/b)t), (a + b)sin(t) - bsin(((a +
b)/b)t)). To change the variables a, b, and t<sub>0</sub>, use the
following keys on the
appropriate line in the control window:<br>
<br>
[&lt;]: Decrease variable<sub></sub> by one step.<br>
[&gt;]: Increase variable by one step.<br>
[&lt;&lt;]: Decrease variable until it reaches its minimum value.<br>
[&gt;&gt;]: Increase variable until it reaches its maximum value.<br>
<br>
By default, the demo shows the point tracing out the curve, so that
only part of it is shown. To show the entire curve, check the box "Show
entire curve" by clicking on it. Click on the "Show position vector X(t<sub>0</sub>)"
box to show the position vector X(t<sub>0</sub>) whose components
are the coordinates of the point X(t<sub>0</sub>).
