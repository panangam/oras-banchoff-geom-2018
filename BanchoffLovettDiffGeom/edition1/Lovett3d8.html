<body>
This demo includes a single graphical display window that displays the
space cardioid X(t) = ((1 + cos(t))cos(t), (1 + cos(t))sin(t), sin(t)).
You can change t<sub>0</sub> and X(t) and choose whether or not to show
the entire curve and the position vector X(t<sub>0</sub>) in the
control window. <br>
<br>
Note how the curve appears for each of the views along one of the axes,
which you can select under the <b>View</b> menu or by having the graphical
display window selected and pressing x, y, z, Shift + x, Shift + y, or
Shift + z on the keyboard.<br>
