<P>The window "Surface" shows the surface X(u,v) and a single parallel surface X<sup>r</sup>(u,v).  The distance between the original surface and the parallel surface is determined by the variable r. <br><br>

In the "Domain" window, the grid indicates the domain of the surface and the color-coded square patch serves as the domain for the parallel surface. <br><br>

The "Normal Image" window displays the normal map of  both the original surface and the parallel surface. <br><br>

The colors of the patch, oriented clockwise, are magenta, blue, white and red. When the parallel surface lies on the original surface (i.e., when r = 0), the orientation of the square patch on the normal map is reversed; instead of having a clockwise orientation, the colors have a counterclockwise orientation. As the value of r is increased past 0, the parallel surface rises. Note that the Gauss map of the surface and the parallel surface remain the same. At a certain value of r, the parallel surface begins to fold over on itself and the orientation of the normal image changes as a result. A similar effect occurs for negative values of r.
