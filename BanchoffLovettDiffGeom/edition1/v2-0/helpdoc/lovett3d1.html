<body>
This demo includes a single graphical display window that displays the
line X(t) = A + tC. You can change the points A and C by clicking and
dragging them in the graphical display window. You can move X(t0) by changing
the t0 variable in the control window.<p>

As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve", "Show Color Spectrum", and "Show position vector" checkboxes.
