<body>
This demo includes two graphical display windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t), the point X(t<sub>0</sub>),
and unit tangent, principal normal, and binormal vectors T(t<sub>0</sub>),
P(t<sub>0</sub>), and B(t<sub>0</sub>), with their tails at X(t<sub>0</sub>).<br>

<br>
The window "Unit Tangent (T), Unit Normal (P), and Unit Binormal (B)"
displays the unit tangent, principal normal, and binormal
vectors T(t<sub>0</sub>), P(t<sub>0</sub>), and B(t<sub>0</sub>) and
the unit sphere on
which their heads are constrained to lie.<br>
<br>
You can change t<sub>0</sub> and X(t) in the control window. The
control window
includes a list of functions that you can use for X(t), along with
parameters used to define those functions.<br>
<br>
As in previous demos there is a "Show Color Spectrum" checkbox.
