<body>
This demo displays two graphical windows: the domain of a surface and that surface with its normal vector and tangent plane.<p>

u and v coordinate lines may be moved by changing the values of u<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub> in the control window.
You may enter new surfaces by typing in a new function in the X(u,v) definition, and many of the surfaces may be modified 
by chaning the a, b, and c variables.<p>

For easier viewing, changing the rotation variable will rotate the entire graph about the normal line of the surface.
