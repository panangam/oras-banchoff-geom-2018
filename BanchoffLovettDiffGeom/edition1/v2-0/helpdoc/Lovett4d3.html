This demo displays the several example functions of simple space curves.
A curve is simple if it does not intersect itself, except in the case of
a closed curve it intersects itself at X(t0_min)=X(t0_max).
To change which funtion is viewed,
type the function title into the definition of X(t).  For example, X(t)=saddlet).
<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<p>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve", "Show Color Spectrum", and "Show Position Vector" checkboxes.
