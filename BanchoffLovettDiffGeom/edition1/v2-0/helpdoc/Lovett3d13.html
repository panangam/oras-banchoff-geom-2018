<body>
This demo includes three graphical display windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t) with its Frenet Frame, the osculating sphere to the
curve at X(t<sub>0</sub>), and the center of the osculating sphere, C(t<sub>0</sub>).<br>

<br>
The windows "Curvature(t)" and "Torsion(t)" graph the curvature
and torsion, respectively, of X(t). Note the dependence of the radius
of the sphere on these two quantities.<br>
<br>
You can change t<sub>0</sub> and X(t) in the control window. The
control window
includes a list of functions that you can use for X(t), along with
parameters used to define those functions.<br>
<br>
As in previous demos there is "Show Color Spectrum" checkbox.
