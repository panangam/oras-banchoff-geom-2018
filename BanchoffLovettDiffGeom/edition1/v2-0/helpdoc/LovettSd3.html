This demo displays three graphical windows: the domain of a surface, the surface itself, and a sphere on which the normal image of the surface is displayed.<p>

The domain window displays a white grid which marks the domain of the surface.  Within this is a wireframe patch that is moved and resized using hotspots.
This patch is then displayed on the surface and in turn on the normal image.<p>

The checkboxes "Color by Theta" and "Color by r" allow you to color the movable patch by the respective variables.
It is informative to color by theta and see if the normal image maintains the same orientation as the patch in the domain.
