This demo includes one graphical display window that shows the curve
X(t) and the point X(t0).<br>
<br>
The control window displays the arclength L of X(t), the area A
enclosed by X(t) if X(t) is a simple curve, and the ratio L<sup>2</sup>/4&pi;A,
which is always greater than or equal to 1 according to the
isoperimetric inequality. <br>
<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.<br>
