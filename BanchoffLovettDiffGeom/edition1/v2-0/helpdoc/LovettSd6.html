This demo displays one graphical window: a sphere with three great circles.<p>

Each great circle is determined by two of three hotspots.  You may move each one by moving its hotspots.
These great circles determine double lunes and a double triangle on the sphere.
You may turn off the coloring of a double lune by changing the Show color constant to false.
Readouts display the values of the angles on the sphere determined by two great circles.
The AngleSum readout displays the sum of these angles which is always greater than &pi;.
The area of the triangle determined (on a unit sphere) by the difference between this angle sum and &pi;.
