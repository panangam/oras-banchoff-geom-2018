This demo displays the several example functions of closed curves.
  A closed curve is a curve such that X(t0_min)=X(t0_max).  To change which funtion is viewed,
type the function title into the definition of X(t).  For example, X(t)=ellipse(t).
<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
