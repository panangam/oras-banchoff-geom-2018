<body>
This demo includes a single graphical window that displays the curve
X(t), the point X(t<sub>0</sub>), the position vector X(t<sub>0</sub>),
and the tangent vector T(t<sub>0</sub>)
with its tail at
X(t<sub>0</sub>).<p>
You can change t<sub>0</sub> and X(t) in the control window. The
control window
includes a list of functions that you can use for X(t), along with
parameters used to define those functions.<p>
As in previous demos is a "Show Color Spectrum" checkbox.
