<body>
This demo displays a curve on a sphere, X(t) = (cos<sup>2</sup>(t),
sin(t)cos(t), sin(t)), which is a closed curve. Note that this is an
example of a closed curve that intersects itself. Change t0 as in previous demos.
<p>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve", "Show Color Spectrum", and "Show Position Vector" checkboxes.
