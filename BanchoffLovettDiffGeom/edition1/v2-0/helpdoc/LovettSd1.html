<body>
This demo displays two graphical windows: the domain of a surface and that surface.<p>

u and v coordinate lines may be moved by changing the values of u<sub>0</sub> and v<sub>0</sub> in the control window.
The checkboxes "Color by u" and "Color by v" allow you to color the surface and the domain
in spectrum color determined by the selected variable.  You will only be able to view one of these at a time.
