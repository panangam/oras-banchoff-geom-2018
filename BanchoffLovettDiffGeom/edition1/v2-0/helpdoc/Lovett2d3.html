<body>
This demo includes two windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t).
Several example curves are provided to enter in the control window as
in earlier demos.<br>
<br>
The window "Perturbed Tangential Image" displays the tangent vector
T(t<sub>0</sub>) and a curve that it traces out. The tangent vector is
perturbed slightly so that the curve that it
traces out does not overlap itself.<br>

<br>
The rotation index is the total change of direction angle from t<sub>min</sub> to
t<sub>max</sub> divided by 2&#960;, which is visualized in the "Perturbed Tangential
Image" window. <br>
<br>
<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
