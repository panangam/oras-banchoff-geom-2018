<body>
This demo includes two graphical display windows. <br>
<br>
The window "Curve, T(t0), and U(t0)" displays the curve given by X(t) (which you may alter
in the appropriate textbox in the control window), the point X(t0), and
the unit tangent and unit normal vectors T(t0) and U(t0) with X(t0) as
their base.<br>
<br>
The window "T(t) and U(t)" displays the unit tangent and unit normal
vectors with their base at the origin and the unit circle on which the
heads of those vectors must lie.<br>

<br>
Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve", "Show position
vector X(t0)" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
"Show Color Spectrum" also colors the tangent and normal vectors.
