<body>
This demo includes a single graphical window that displays a curve
X(t) (which you may change in the appropriate textbox in the control
window), the point X(t<sub>0</sub>), the unit tangent vector T(t<sub>0</sub>)
with base X(t<sub>0</sub>),
the involute curve I(t) = X(t) + (k &#8211; s(t))T(t) for parameter c defined
in the control window, and, if the "String" box in the control window
is checked, a curve showing that one can interpret the involute curve
as the result of winding or unwinding a string around the curve X(t)
and having the end of the string trace out a curve. The control window
lists several curves that you may enter for X(t). For example, type
cardioid(t) in the textbox for X(t) to make X(t) a cardioid. The
control window also includes parameters used in defining these curves.
<br>
Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.
<br>
As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve", "Show position
vector X(t0)" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
"Show Color Spectrum" also colors the tangent vector and the involute.
