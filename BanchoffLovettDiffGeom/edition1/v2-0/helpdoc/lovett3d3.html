<body>
This demo includes a single graphical display window that displays the
curve X(t) = A + x(t)B + y(t)C. By default, it shows a circle of radius
r with x(t) = r*cos(t) and y(t) = r *sin(t). You can change t<sub>0</sub>,
A, B, C, r, x(t), and y(t) in the control window.
<p>
As in previous demos there are "Show Color Spectrum", "Show entire curve", and "Show position vector" checkboxes.
