<body>
This demo includes two graphical display windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t),
the point X(t0), a point P with its position vector, and a unit circle
centered at the origin. You can drag the point P along the unit circle
shown in the window.<br>
<br>
The window h(t) shows a graph of the height function h(t) = X(t)*P.<br>

<br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.<br>
 As in earlier demos, there is the "Show Color Spectrum" option.<br>
