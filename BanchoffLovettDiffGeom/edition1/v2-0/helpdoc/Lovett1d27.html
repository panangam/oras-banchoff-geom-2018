<body>
This demo includes a single graphical window that displays a curve
X(t) (which you may change in the appropriate textbox in the control
window), the osculating circle to X(t) at X(t<sub>0</sub>), the line
segment from
the center of the osculating circle to X(t<sub>0</sub>), which is
normal to the
curve and has length given by 1/kg(t<sub>0</sub>), and the evolute
curve, which is traced out by the center of the osculating circle. <br>
br>Change the value of t<sub>0</sub> and other variables as in earlier demos.
As in earlier demos, there are "Show entire curve" and "Show Color Spectrum" options.
"Show Color Spectrum" also colors the osculation cirlce, its radius, and the evolute curve.
"Show Parallel Curve" displays parallel curves at distance d.  Note that as 
d changes, the cusps of the parallel curves lie on the evolute.
