This demo displays a sphere and a curve on the sphere. <br><br> The length of the curve is given in a readout in the control
window. <br><br> A hotspot P on the curve determines another point Q halfway
around the curve from P. A point M, which is the midpoint of P and
Q on the sphere, is displayed. A red great circle is displayed
with M as the north pole.&nbsp; If the length of the curve is less than
2&#960;, the hemisphere will contain the curve. <br><br> Changing alpha rotates the half of the curve from P to Q around
the north pole M, thus demonstrating the proof of the lemma.</body>
