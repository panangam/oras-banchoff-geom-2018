The "Domain" window in this demonstration displays a domain as a
wireframe, a point (u<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>) in the domain, and
the u-constant and
v-constant curves through that point in red and green, respectively.
The "Surface X(u,v)" window shows the sphere X(u,v) = (Rcos(u)cos(v),
Rsin(u)cos(v), Rsin(v)) for the
given domain and the images of the point and the curves from the
"Domain" window. It is possible to change u<sub>0</sub>, v<sub>0</sub>,
and R in the control
window.<br>
