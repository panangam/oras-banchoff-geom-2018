  <title>curve on sphered</title>
</head>
<body>
<ul>
  <li>A sphere is specified in the control window, and its radius may
be changed by changing the variable R.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A curve is displayed on the circle, and the curve is the
projection of the curve x(t) onto the sphere.&nbsp; This projected
curve is specified in the control window.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A point along this image curve is a white sphere specified by
changing the value of t0.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The tangent vector at this point T is displayed in red.&nbsp; The
normal vector
N is displayed in blue.&nbsp; The U vector is displayed in magenta.</li>
  <li>Readouts in the control window display the values of geodesic
curvature, geodesic torsion, and normal curvature at the white point
specified by t0.</li>
  <li>Readouts in the control window display the total geodesic
curvature, geodesic torsion, and normal curvature along the whole image
curve.</li>
  <li>The normal curvature along the whole curve is displayed in pink
in the "Kn(t)" window.</li>
  <li>The geodesic curvature along the whole curve is displayed in
orange in the "Kg(t)" window.</li>
  <li>The geodesic torsion along the whole curve is displayed in cyan
in the "Tg(t)" window.</li>
</ul>
