<body>
This demo includes two graphical display windows.<br>
<br>
The window "Curve: X(t)" displays the curve X(t) and the point X(t<sub>0</sub>).<br>
<br>
The window "kg(t)" shows a graph of kg(t) and the point (t<sub>0</sub>,
k<sub>g</sub>(t<sub>0</sub>)).
Note that, as stated in the Four-Vertex Theorem, there are always at
least four critical points of k<sub>g</sub>(t).<br>
<br>
You can change t<sub>0</sub> and X(t) in the control window. The
control window also includes a list of curves that you can enter for
X(t) and parameters used in defining those curves. For example, enter
cardioid(t) in the X(t) textbox to make X(t) a cardioid. Changing k
will then change the cardioid.<br>
