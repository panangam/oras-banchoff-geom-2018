  <li>
A closed surface X(u,v) in shown in the "Surface" window. </li>
  <li>The triangulation of this surface is shown in the "Triangulation" window. </li>
  <li>The number of divisions in the u- and v-directions can be changed by typing in different values for Steps1 and Steps2 in the control window. </li>
  <li>The control panel shows the number of vertices, edges, and triangles (faces) in the triangulation. The Euler characteristic of the surface is calculated from these numbers. </li>
