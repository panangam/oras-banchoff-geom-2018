The window "Curve: X(t)" in this demonstration displays the curve X(t)
= (cos(t), sin(t), cos(2t)/c), the point X(t<sub>0</sub>), and the
tangent,
normal, and binormal vectors T(t<sub>0</sub>), P(t<sub>0</sub>), and B(t<sub>0</sub>),
with their tails
at that point. <br><br> The window "Spherical Images: T, P, B" displays the same
three vectors with their tails at the origin, the sphere on which their
heads are constrained to lie, and the tangential indicatrix. <br><br> The total
length of the tangential indicatrix, displayed in a readout in the
control window, is called the total curvatuve of
the curve X(t). It is possible to
change c, t<sub>0</sub>, and X(t) in the control window. It is also
possible to set X(t) equal to circle(t) or spacecardioid(t), options listed in
the control window.<br>
