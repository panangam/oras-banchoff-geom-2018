This demo animates the deformation from the catenoid to the helicoid and displays the graph of mean curvature. <br>
<br>

The demo uses the variable c instead of the variable t that is used in the text of the problem.  Furthermore, in the problem we use the weighted average pair (1 &#8211; t,t), while the demo uses instead the pair (cos(c),sin(c)).  The user should feel free to change the weighting between the two minimal surfaces and observe any difference.
