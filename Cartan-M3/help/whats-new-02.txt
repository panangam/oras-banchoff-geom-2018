Version 2 includes one new feature:  the ability to create only a single square face.  You do so by using a pair of edges in the "Show Faces Formed by" type-in area.  For example:

    {12 34}

will generate a single square.  Note that these squares are always drawn in grey (unless "multi-colored" is selected), since it is not possible to tell if it is part of an RP2 or not.

In addition to this new feature, typos were corrected in several of the help files.
