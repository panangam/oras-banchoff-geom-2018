This demonstration lets you investigate a polyhedral model of Cartan's surface.  The model considers the dual polytope, D, to the hypercube in dimension 6, which consists of 12 vertices and 64 faces that are all 5-simplices.  This polytope is sliced by a hyperplane perpendicular to the long diagonal of the cube, and the result is a polyhedral 4-manifold that can be thought of as the "equitorial 4-sphere" of D.

D consists of a 5-simplex, D+, near one corner of the hypercube, a 5-simplex, D-, near the opposite corner, and 62 5-simplices in between that are sliced by the hyperplane.  Within D+ we can embed the 6-vertex triangulation of the real projective plane, and can do the same in D-.  If we now consider only those cells of D whose intersections with D+ and D- lie in this RP2, then we obtain a 3-manifold embedded within the equitorial 4-sphere.  This is a polyhedral object that corresponds to Cartan's 3-manifold.
