Version 3 fixes a problem with the SAVE button (it always saved to the directory containing Cartan-M3-02.cs, rather than the data or other directory, even if that was where you saved the file originally).

It also includes one new feature:  the ability to apply an arbitrary permutation to faces in the "Show Faces Formed by" type-in area.  This is still in development, but the idea is that you can say

    Permute("(15)",{{123 456} {124 356}})

and the result will be equivalent to

   {235 146} {245 136}

You can use any permutation, such as "(123)(56)", but each number should only appear once (permutation multiplication isn't performed).

One problem currently is that the list of faces passed to Permute() needs to include at least two pairs.
