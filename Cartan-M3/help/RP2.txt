The projective plane that is used to form the Cartan surface is given by the following faces:

      124 125 134 136 156
      235 236 246 345 456

These are invariant under the symmetries (123)(456), (23)(56) and (13562).

A copy of this is used in D+ and a corresponding copy in D-.  The slices of the 5-simplices that are formed by a triangle in one of the D's and an edge on the other are what form the polyhedral model of the Cartan surface.
